# Frontend Mentor Challenge - FAQ Accordion Card 

The challenge was to build out a responsive FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

Tools I used: React & Sass. 

Here are some photos of the final product:

## What I Learned from this Project?

First, building this card required meticulous work  positioning and aligning severl images in a responsive, well-organized way. I discovered the \<Picture> HTML element, which is very useful in a case of using different images based on screen width.

second, this project was a great opportunity to practice some basic React workflows and the BEM methodology combining with Sass structure.
